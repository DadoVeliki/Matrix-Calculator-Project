                    <h2>Seven is the favorite number</h2>
                    <p>You might have guessed that most people's favorite number is 7 but that's now been proven.

                        A recent online poll of 3,000 people by Alex Bellos found that around 10% of them chose seven, with three as the runner-up.
                        
                        That might be because seven has so many favorable connections (seven wonders of the world, pillars of wisdom, seven seas, seven dwarves, seven days, seven colors in the rainbow). But it's also true that seven is "arithmetically unique" - the only single number you can't multiply or divide while keeping the answer within the 1-10 group.</p>

                    <p>Weirdly, random numbers aren't actually all that random. In a given list of numbers representing anything from populations to building heights to border lengths, fully one-third of them will begin with the digit 1. Fewer will begin with 2 and so on until only one number in twenty begins with a 9. The bigger the data set, and the more orders of magnitude it spans, the more strongly this pattern emerges.</p>

                    <p>The “trick” here is to not think of a cake as a two-dimensional circle, as most people tend to, but instead as the three-dimensional cylinder, which it is. This then allows us to not only make the usual vertical cuts, but we can now also make a horizontal cut. So if you use two of your cuts to form a cross on the top of the cake, effectively splitting the cake into four equal parts, and use your third cut as a horizontal cut through the centre of the cake, effectively splitting each of the four equal parts in half, you will achieve your 8 equal pieces.</p>

                    <h2>Multiplying ones will always give you palindromic numbers.</h2>
                    <p>For those who are unaware, a palindromic number is simply a number that is the same backwards as forwards, for example, 23432.

                        So, if you calculate 1 × 1, we get 1. Ok, that’s a bit of a lazy palindrome, let’s move on.
                        
                        Furthermore, it is not necessary to have the same number of ones in the two numbers you are multiplying. For example 11 × 1111 = 12221 and
                        111111 × 1111 = 123444321.

                    <h2>A useful trick for percentages.</h2>
                    <p>Did you know that x% of y = y% of x?

                        This can make working out percentages a much easier task. For example, try to calculate 8% of 50 in your head. Not so easy right. Now flip it and instead work out 50% of 8, I think it’s clear which is easier.
                        Similarly, 32% of 75 may seem difficult to calculate, but 75% of 32 seems a much easier challenge.
